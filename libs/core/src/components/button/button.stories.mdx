# Button

## Button variants

Buttons exist in three different variants, Primary, Secondary and Tertiary

<Canvas>
  <gds-button>Primary</gds-button>
  <gds-button secondary>Secondary</gds-button>
  <gds-button tertiary>Tertiary</gds-button>
</Canvas>

## Button sets

Each variant can belong to one of three sets, Neutral, Positive and Negative

<Canvas>
  <story-grid>
    <story-row>
      <gds-button>Neutral primary</gds-button>
      <gds-button secondary>Neutral secondary</gds-button>
      <gds-button tertiary>Neutral tertiary</gds-button>
    </story-row>
    <story-row>
      <gds-button positive>Positive primary</gds-button>
      <gds-button positive secondary>
        Positive secondary
      </gds-button>
      <gds-button positive tertiary>
        Positive tertiary
      </gds-button>
    </story-row>
    <story-row>
      <gds-button negative>Negative primary</gds-button>
      <gds-button negative secondary>
        Negative secondary
      </gds-button>
      <gds-button negative tertiary>
        Negative tertiary
      </gds-button>
    </story-row>
  </story-grid>
</Canvas>

## Button sizes

Buttons can be small, medium or large. The default size is medium.

<Canvas>
  <gds-button small>Small</gds-button>
  <gds-button>Medium</gds-button>
  <gds-button large>Large</gds-button>
</Canvas>

## Button with icon

Buttons can have an icon on the left or right side of the text. These are called leading or trailing icons, and are added by placing a `gds-icon` component in either the `lead` or `trail` slot.

<Canvas>
  <gds-button style={{'width':'200px'}}>
    <gds-icon slot="lead" name="arrow-down" />
    Leading icon
  </gds-button>
  <gds-button>
    Trailing icon
    <gds-icon slot="trail" name="arrow-up" />
  </gds-button>
</Canvas>

## Button with icon only

If a single `gds-icon` is the only child of a button, it will render as a circular icon button.

<Canvas>
  <gds-button small>
    <gds-icon name="arrow" />
  </gds-button>
  <gds-button>
    <gds-icon name="arrow" />
  </gds-button>
  <gds-button large>
    <gds-icon name="arrow" />
  </gds-button>
</Canvas>

## Disabled

The buttons support a disabled state, but in general, it should not be used. It can be hard for the user to understand why the button is disabled, so it is often better to keep the button clickable and then show an error message
instead.

<Canvas>
  <gds-button disabled>Primary</gds-button>
  <gds-button secondary positive disabled>
    Secondary
  </gds-button>
  <gds-button tertiary disabled>
    Tertiary
  </gds-button>
</Canvas>
